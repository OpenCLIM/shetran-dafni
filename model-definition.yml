  summary: SHETran is a physically-based spatially-distributed hydrological model.
  description: >
    SHETran is a model for water flow, solute and sediment transport in river catchments.
    SHETran is a finite-difference model in which the physics-based governing partial differential equations for flow and transport are solved on a three-dimensional grid.
    SHETran is a physically-based, spatially-distributed (PBSD) modelling system.
    The plan area of the catchment in SHETran is usually in the range of one to a few thousand square kilometers and the horizontal depth of the subsurface is usually less than 100m.
